# RFM Analysis

RFM aims to help businesses identify their target audiences by telling them who the most valuable customers are to the company. 

The RFM model considers consumer's buying habits, including:
- _Recency_ - How recently a client purchased a product
- _Frequency_ - How often do they buy
- _Monetary_ - How much money they spend

With RFM analysis, you can determine what percentage of your customers support the business and leverage this information to develop more effective marketing campaigns while boosting brand loyalty and increasing conversions as customers move along the customer journey.

Predicting future customer behavior through RFM analysis can help businesses understand how likely customers will purchase another product or service and how much they will spend.

For example, you can improve your email marketing success rates by understanding your target audience. Then, can effectively segment them to send personalized emails and offers that are most likely to convert, leading to increased retention rate, customer satisfaction, and sales.
